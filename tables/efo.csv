This bacterius is a ubiquitous plant pathogen with a wide host range (carrot, potato, tomato, leafy greens, squash and other cucurbits, onion, green peppers, African violets etc.), able to cause disease in almost any plant tissue it invades. It is a very economically important pathogen in terms of postharvest losses, and a common cause of decay in stored fruits and vegetables. Decay caused by E. carotovora is often simply referred to as ""bacterial soft rot"" (BSR) though this may also be caused by other bacteria. Most plants or plant parts can resist invasion by the bacteria, unless some type of wound is present. High humidity and temperatures around 30°C favor development of decay. Mutants can be produced which are less virulent. Virulence factors include: pectinases, cellulases, (which degrade plant cell walls), and also proteases, lipases, xylanases and nucleases (along with the normal virulence factors for pathogens – Fe acquisition, LPS integrity, multiple global regulatory systems).",,,

In some cultivars HCRSV induces chlorotic spots in leaves, but in most it induces leaf mottling and/or chlorotic rings. Some cultivars develop no conspicuous symptoms, especially at high average ambient temperatures such as those in summer in Florida (Raju, 1985). Flowers remain symptomless.
Leaves of infected Abelmoschus manihot plants are usually chlorotic, and the chlorosis is more conspicuous when HCRSV occurs in complex with other viruses (AA Brunt and RS Phillips, Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne, UK, personal communication, 1993).""",,,

Although scurvy is relatively rare in the United States, it continues to be a problem in malnourished populations around the world (such as impoverished, underdeveloped third world countries). Early features of the condition include general weakness, fatigue and aching limbs. If left untreated, more serious problems can develop such as anemia , gum disease, and skin hemorrhages . Symptoms generally develop after at least 3 months of severe or total vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy can be cured with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth. Once recovery is complete, dietary modifications to ensure the 'recommended daily intake' of vitamin C is reached will prevent relapse. Except in the case of severe dental disease, permanent damage from scurvy does not usually occur.",,,

Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD. Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1. Required for VEGFA-mediated induction of NOS2 and NOS3, leading to the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells. Phosphorylates PLCG1. Promotes phosphorylation of FYN, NCK1, NOS3, PIK3R1, PTK2/FAK1 and SRC (Uniprot).  Variations in this gene are associated with Hemangioma, capillary infantile (OMIM label).",,,

JIA is an autoimmune, non-infective, inflammatory joint disease of more than 6 weeks duration in children less than 16 years of age. The disease commonly occurs in children from the ages of 7 to 12, but it may occur in adolescents as old as 15 years of age, as well as in infants. It is a subset of arthritis seen in childhood, which may be transient and self-limited or chronic. It differs significantly from arthritis commonly seen in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), and other types of arthritis that can present in childhood which are chronic conditions (e.g. psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Aetiopathology is similar to rheumatoid arthritis but with less marked cartilage erosion, and joint instability and absent rheumatoid factor. JIA affects approximately 1 in 1,000 children in any given year, with about 1 in 10,000 having a more severe form.",,,

Approximately 15 per cent of cases of renal cell carcinoma will be cystic on radiologic and pathologic examination. The clinical features of cystic renal cell carcinoma are similar to those which are solid. The radiographic and pathologic findings of cystic renal cell carcinoma are often more confusing and less specific than the findings of renal cell carcinoma which are predominantly solid. There are four basic pathologic mechanisms resulting in cystic renal cell carcinoma: intrinsic multiloculated growth; intrinsic unilocular growth (cystadenocarcinoma); cystic necrosis; and origin from the epithelial lining of a preexisting simple cyst. There are three basic radiologic patterns of cystic renal cell carcinoma: unilocular cystic mass, multiloculated cystic mass, and discrete mural nodule in a cystic mass. Cystic renal cell carcinoma is often extremely difficult to differentiate from non-neoplastic, benign neoplastic, and other malignant neoplastic masses utilizing radiologic studies alone. This review presents the clinical, pathologic, and radiographic features of cystic renal cell carcinoma and discusses its radiologic differential diagnosis.",,,

This lining is made up of cells called transitional cells that look like the cells that line the ureters and bladder. Cancers that develop from these cells look like other urothelial carcinomas, such as bladder cancer, under the microscope. Like bladder cancer, these cancers are often linked to cigarette smoking and being exposed to certain cancer-causing chemicals in the workplace.

People with TCC often have the same signs and symptoms as people with renal cell cancer − blood in the urine and, sometimes, back pain.

These cancers are usually treated by surgically removing the whole kidney and the ureter, as well as the portion of the bladder where the ureter attaches. Smaller, less aggressive cancers can sometimes be treated with less surgery. Chemotherapy (chemo) is sometimes given before or after surgery, depending on how much cancer is found. The chemo given is the same as that used for bladder cancer. It’s important to talk with your doctor to be aware of your options and the benefits and risks of each treatment. ",,,

Clinical manifestations include dysarthria, dysphagia, facial weakness, tongue weakness, and fasciculations of the tongue and facial muscles. The adult form of the disease is marked initially by bulbar weakness which progresses to involve motor neurons throughout the neuroaxis. Eventually this condition may become indistinguishable from AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS. Fazio-Londe syndrome is an inherited form of this illness which occurs in children and young adults.

Two clones, designated Mono Mac I and Mono Mac 6, were isolated and both were assigned to the monocyte lineage on the basis of morphological, cytochemical and immunological criteria. Most importantly, the clones express NaF-sensitive non-specific-esterase, produce reactive oxygen and stain with MAb My4. Mono Mac 6, in addition, constitutively exhibits phagocytosis of antibody-coated erythrocytes in 80% of the cells and reacts with a panel of MAbs that are specific for mature monocytes, i.e., M42, LeuM3, 63D3, Mo2 and UCHMI. By contrast, the monoblastic cell lines U937 and THP-I are negative for all these markers. Only expression of My4 could be detected after differentiation induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Similar treatment of Mono Mac I, however, resulted in staining with all the monocyte-specific MAbs mentioned above, while IFN-gamma treatment of Mono Mac 6 enhanced antigen expression. In addition, the cells showed an increased frequency of multinucleated cells with a rise from 4.8% to 21.9%. Mono Mac 6 appears to be the only one of the cell lines studied to constitutively express phenotypic and functional features of mature monocytes.",,,

Examples of heavy metals that can cause toxicity include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Exposure may occur through the diet, from medications, from the environment, or in the course of work or play. Heavy metals can enter the body through the skin, or by inhalation or ingestion. Toxicity can result from sudden, severe exposure, or from chronic exposure over time. Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed. For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs, and may increase the risk of cancer. Treatment depends on the circumstances of the exposure.",,,

Symptoms and physical findings associated with heavy metal poisoning vary according to the metal accumulated. Many of the heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, chromium, iron and manganese, are essential to body function in very small amounts. But, if these metals accumulate in the body in concentrations sufficient to cause poisoning, then serious damage may occur. The heavy metals most commonly associated with poisoning of humans are lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium. Heavy metal poisoning may occur as a result of industrial exposure, air or water pollution, foods, medicines, improperly coated food containers, or the ingestion of lead-based paints.",,,

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0003276,EFO:0003276,EFO:0003276,vascular endothelial growth factor,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues when blood circulation is inadequate. Serum concentration of VEGF is high in bronchial asthma and low in diabetes mellitus. VEGF's normal function is to create new blood vessels during embryonic development, new blood vessels after injury, muscle following exercise, and new vessels (collateral circulation) to bypass blocked vessels.
When VEGF is overexpressed, it can contribute to disease. Solid cancers cannot grow beyond a limited size without an adequate blood supply; cancers that can express VEGF are able to grow and metastasize. Overexpression of VEGF can cause vascular disease in the retina of the eye and other parts of the body. Drugs such as bevacizumab can inhibit VEGF and control or slow those diseases.
VEGF is a sub-family of growth factors, to be specific, the platelet-derived growth factor family of cystine-knot growth factors. They are important signaling proteins involved in both vasculogenesis (the de novo formation of the embryonic circulatory system) and angiogenesis (the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature).",,,

There are several different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma , a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess , is a third kind of aspergillosis. This type of aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas.",,,

Increasingly the concept is used synonymously with race but this use trend has a pragmatic basis rather than scientific. (NCI); The concept of ethnic origin is an attempt to classify people, not according to their current ethnicity, but according to where their ancestors came from. Ethnic origin has become a popular classification in statistics, where the concept of race has been largely discarded.

CCL5 is a Chemoattractant for blood monocytes, memory T-helper cells and eosinophils. Causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. May activate several chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR3, CCR4 and CCR5. One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant RANTES protein induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The processed form RANTES(3-68) acts as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. The second processed form RANTES(4-68) exhibits reduced chemotactic and HIV-suppressive activity compared with RANTES(1-68) and RANTES(3-68) and is generated by an unidentified enzyme associated with monocytes and neutrophils (PubMed:16791620, PubMed:1380064, PubMed:8525373, PubMed:9516414, PubMed:15923218). May also be an agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR75, stimulating inositol trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization through its activation. Together with GPR75, may play a role in neuron survival through activation of a downstream signaling pathway involving the PI3, Akt and MAP kinases. By activating GPR75 may also play a role in insulin secretion by islet cells (PubMed:23979485).

He developed seizures in the first month of life and did not acquire any developmental milestones. Brain imaging at 4 months of age showed diffuse cerebral atrophy with thinning of the corpus callosum, and ophthalmologic examination showed myopic astigmatism. He died at age 1 year due to a severe respiratory infection. The proband was a 3-year-old boy with global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly (-9 SD), no head control, no speech, and generalized hypotonia with contractures of the ankles and fingers. He developed refractory seizures at 2 months of age. He also had swallowing difficulties and was tube-fed. Both patients had dysmorphic facial features, including low-set ears, long eyelashes, sloping forehead, micrognathia, and short nose with flat nasal bridge. Brain imaging showed progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, decreased white matter, subcortical white matter hyperintensities, and thinning of corpus callosum.

It is usually caused by atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In order to maintain adequate perfusion of the arm during exercise on the affected side, the narrowed subclavian artery siphons off retrograde blood flow from the ipsilateral vertebral artery. This is possible due to lower blood pressure distal to the site of narrowing and collateral circulation through the circle of Willis. Affected individuals may remain asymptomatic until the oxygen demand generated from upper extremity exercise requires a large enough compensatory volume of blood to be diverted from the vertebral artery to provoke vertebrobasilar insufficiency and its accompanying neurological sequelae. Presenting clinical signs may include pain or numbness of the affected arm (with diminished pulses and a brachial systolic blood pressure differential of greater than 20 mmHg as compared to the opposite arm), vertigo, tinnitus, dysarthria, diplopia and syncope. Notably, unlike cerebral infarction, the clinical course does not lead to chronic neurologic disability.

While many people with HPS don't have any obvious problems, the main reported symptom is shortness of breath (dyspnea) that is worse when standing or sitting up, and is relieved when lying down (platypnea). Symptoms related to chronic liver disease (generally cirrhosis ) include small red spots on the skin ( spider angiomas ) and abnormal vascular dilatations. Some other symptoms that have been described are infections in the brain (brain abscesses), brain bleeding and an increased number of red blood cells in the blood (polycythemia).

There are two major types of beriberi: wet beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry beriberi which affects the nervous system. People with wet beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. Signs and symptoms of dry beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. Beriberi is rare in the United States since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. In most cases,beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods. Treatment generally includes thiamine supplementation, given by injection or taken by mouth.",,,

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007727,EFO:0007727,EFO:0007727,CAST/EiJ,"

Both CAST/EiJ and CASA/RkJ (Stock No. 000735) were derived from wild mice trapped in Thailand. CAST is often combined with the common laboratory strains to generate F1 hybrids with high levels of heterozygosity for use in genetic mapping. Unlike the wild-derived strain SPRET, male F1 mice from a CAST cross are fertile.

Like CASA, CAST is resistant to flavivirus infection. The flavivirus family includes pathogens responsible for dengue, yellow fever and several forms of encephalitis. Most common laboratory mice are sensitive to flavivirus infection. Resistance/sensitivity is conferred through the oligoA synthase Oas1b locus. In a comparison of multiple strains, CASA and CAST exhibit reduced numbers of retinal ganglion cells as compared to common laboratory strains and other wild-derived strains. In a 2015 study comparing CAST/Ei and the other Collaborative Cross inbred strains (A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, and WSB/EiJ), dorsal root ganglion neurons from CAST/Ei mice demonstrate a significantly improved ability to regenerate axons in an inhibitory environment as determined by an increase in number of neurons with neurites and longer axonal process per neuron under both naive and pre-injured conditions. In addition, as compared to neurons from C57BL/6 mice, CAST/Ei neurons exhibit more extensive axonal regeneration in the spinal cord and optic nerve following injury and show greater sprouting following ischemic stroke.

Wild-derived mice are genetically distinct from common laboratory mice for a number of complex phenotypic characteristics and are valuable tools for genetic mapping, evolution and systematics research.

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007728,EFO:0007728,EFO:0007728,FVB/NJ,"FVB/NJ was inbred for the Fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukemia virus B strain. Due to the prominent pronuclei in their fertilized eggs and the large litter size, FVB/NJ mice are commonly used for transgenic injection. Compared to many other inbred strains, FVB/NJ is highly susceptible to asthma-like airway responsiveness with significant generation of antigen-specific IgE. Despite having the H2q MHC haplotype, FVB/NJ are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis. This resistance stems from coding polymorphisms in Tcra-V11.1 and a genomic deletion of some Tcrb-V genes that includes Tcrb-V8.2. FVB/NJ have higher than average activity, anxiety, and basal body temperature, low stress-induced hyperthermia, and are homozygous for the Pde6brd1 allele, which results in early onset retinal degeneration. Although FVB/N typically do not develop spontaneous tumors, they are highly susceptible to chemically induced squamous cell carcinomas with a high rate of malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma.

(NZO/Hl x NON/ShiLt)F1 hybrids will develop diabetes slightly faster than their reciprocal cross due to the NZO maternal environment; however this cross is difficult to produce due to the inherently poor breeding performance of NZO/HlJ female mice. F1 females exhibit a weight gain similar to the NZO parent, and have impaired glucose tolerance but are resistant to diabetes development. Diabetes development can be accelerated to eight to 12 weeks by fostering onto an F1 dam. Reciprocal backcrosses to the parental strains and analysis of (NON/ShiLt x NZO/Hl)F2 mice has led to the identification of a number of complex diabetes-predisposing (""diabesity"") QTLs. Dr. Leiter's research group at The Jackson Laboratory is currently developing a series of nine recombinant congenic strains (RCS) made by backcrossing the (NZO/Hl x NON/ShiLt)F1 for two generations onto the NON/ShiLt background before inbreeding (~12% NZO/Hl, 88% NON/ShiLt genomes). Preliminary analysis indicates that body weight gains of all RCS are higher than NON/ShiLt, but none are as obese as NZO/Hl; some of these RCS develop NIDDM while others are resistant. These new strains will be useful to further analyze diabesity QTLs and as new models for type 2 (NIDDM) diabetes. An additional benefit of the RCS is better breeding performance than NZO/Hl.",,,

Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature. The condition has been linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6 it is therefore classified as a channelopathy The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.
Treatment of the hypokalemia, followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete resolution of the attacks.

Likely at least partially due to its superoxide dismutase activity, TEMPOL shows radioprotective, life-prolonging properties in animal models, suggesting its potential usefulness for treatment of human diseases.[1] It is currently being studied in human subjects for prevention of radiation-induced alopecia.[2]
This nitroxide antioxidant or its derivatives are also undergoing prospective clinical studies in several clinical conditions. In addition to radioprotection, these include high blood pressure[3][4] and macular degeneration[5]. A published patent[6] claims other clinical uses for TEMPOL and related compounds. These include treatment of fibrocystic disease of breast, menstrual cramps and their associated symptoms, migraine, hemorrhoids, neuropathic pain, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and peridontitis. The patent also claims treatment of the symptoms of influenza, herpes zoster and herpes simplex.

Most humans acquire toxoplasmosis by eating raw or undercooked meat, vegetables or milk products, or by coming into contact with infected cat litterbox or sandboxes.In humans,the infectionusually causes no symptoms, and resolves without treatment in a few months. In individuals with compromised immune systems, Toxoplasm a gondii can reactivate to cause disease. Reactivation of a congenital infection was traditionally thought to be the most common cause ofocular toxoplasmosis, but an acquired infection is now considered to be more common. A toxoplasmosis infection that affects the eye usually attacks the retina andinitially resolves without symptoms.

Blood is normally a sterile environment, so the detection of bacteria in the blood (most commonly accomplished by blood cultures) is always abnormal. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream as a severe complication of infections (like pneumonia or meningitis), during surgery (especially when involving mucous membranes such as the gastrointestinal tract), or due to catheters and other foreign bodies entering the arteries or veins (including during intravenous drug abuse).

Bacteremia can have several consequences. The immune response to the bacteria can cause sepsis and septic shock, which has a relatively high mortality rate. Bacteria can also use the blood to spread to other parts of the body (which is called hematogenous spread), causing infections away from the original site of infection. Examples include endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Treatment is with antibiotics, and prevention with antibiotic prophylaxis can be given in situations where problems are to be expected.",,,

Currently, the preferred term for both conditions is “ anti-GBM antibody disease ”. Circulating antibodies are directed against the collagen of the part of the kidney known as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulting in acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Antibodies also attack the collagen of the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) resulting in bleeding of the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage). Symptoms may include general body discomfort or pain, bleeding from the nose and/or blood in the urine, respiratory problems, anemia, chest pain, and kidney failure. Anti-GBM disease is thought to result from an environmental insult (smoking, infections, exposure to certain drugs) in a person with genetic susceptibility, such as a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of anti-GBM antibody in the blood or in the kidney. The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis in conjunction with prednisone and cyclophosphamide.",,,

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007736,EFO:0007736,EFO:0007736,NOD/ShiLtJ,"Diabetes in NOD/ShiLtJ mice is characterized by insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. Marked decreases in pancreatic insulin content occur in females at about 12 weeks of age and several weeks later in males. Onset of diabetes is marked by moderate glycosuria and by a non-fasting plasma glucose higher than 250 mg/dl. Diabetic mice are hypoinsulinemic and hyperglucagonemic, indicating a selective destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. Susceptibility to IDDM in NOD/ShiLtJ mice is polygenic, and environment, including housing conditions, health status, and diet, exerts a strong effect on penetrance. NOD/ShiLtJ females are more widely used than males because the onset of IDDM symptoms occurs earlier and with a higher incidence (90-100% by 30 weeks of age). NOD/ShiLtJ males develop IDDM at a frequency of between 40-60% by 30-40 weeks of age. Male mice are useful for certain applications, including pharmaceutical studies, ""accelerated transfer"" of IDDM, and some in vitro studies. The major component of diabetes susceptibility in NOD mice is the unique MHC haplotype (H2g7 = Kd, Aad, Abg7, Enull, Db). NOD mice also exhibit multiple aberrant immunophenotypes including defective antigen presenting cell immunoregulatory functions, defects in the regulation of theT lymphocyte repertoire, defective NK cell function, defective cytokine production from macrophages (Fan et al., 2004) and impaired wound healing. They also lack hemolytic complement, C5. NOD/ShiLtJ mice also are severely hearing-impaired. A variety of mutations causing immunodeficiencies, targeted mutations in cytokine genes, as well as transgenes affecting immune functions, have been backcrossed into the NOD/ShiLt inbred strain background.

Diabetes onset was monitored weekly between the ages of 3 and 30 weeks in 120 male and 120 female NOD/ShiLtJ bred in the Bar Harbor and Sacramento facilities. Mice were fed a 6% fat diet (LabDiet 5K0Q, St. Louis MO), ad libitum. Diabetes was defined by a non-fasting blood glucose level exceeding 250 mg/dL. Blood was sampled from the submandibular route and analyzed using a OneTouch Ultra 2 handheld glucometer that was validated using a control solution on each measurement day. Data were combined from three independent studies, each involving 40 males and 40 females. The median female onset was 17 weeks in each study, and the Kaplan-Meier curves from the individual studies did not differ significantly. ",,,

Gaucher's disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases It is a form of sphingolipidosis (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelets, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. It is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucosylceramidase. The enzyme acts on the fatty acid glucosylceramide. When the enzyme is defective, glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood cells, most often macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes). Glucosylceramidase can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow.
Symptoms may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders and bone lesions that may be painful, severe neurologic complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelets and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons affected most seriously may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.
The disease is caused by a recessive mutation in a gene located on chromosome 1 and affects both males and females. About 1 in 100 people in the United States are carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is 1 in 450",true,Orphanet:355 ,Orphanet:355

It allows sampling of specific cells under direct microscopic visualization by a pathologist. A film is placed against the heterogeneous tissue and activated by a laser beam to capture only the cells of interest. Those cells are transferred to the film to provide a visual microscopic record of what was transferred, which can be analyzed for DNA, RNA, or protein. The film upon which the cells are transferred is incorporated into the cap of a vial so that, when the transfer is done under a routine microscopic visualization, the microdissected material can immediately be put into a vial for processing. The system is integrated into a pathologist's microscope so that the cells are microdissected, transferred to the cap, and then rotated into a vial by a rotating arm in a hands-off operation.

Researchers suggest this is a result of an innate mechanism in which Ucn2 acts to improve function of the failing heart [2]. The pathophysiology of heart failure is often a consequence of improper calcium handling and relaxation resulting in a lower cardiac output, decreased blood flow and overall decreased heart function [3]. Infusion of Ucn2 in healthy humans has shown a dose dependent increase in cardiac output, heart rate and left ventricle ejection fraction and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance [4].

Children with LKS typically develop normally until signs and symptoms of the syndrome begin to develop between age 2 and 8 years. Males are more often affected by LKS than females. In about 20% of people with LKS, mutations (changes) in the GRIN2A gene have been identified. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In other cases, the syndrome may be caused by changes to other unidentified genes. LKS is diagnosed when a doctor sees clinical features that are consistent with the syndrome such as a loss of speech and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows specific kinds of seizure activity. Genetic testing can be used to confirm if there is a mutation in GRIN2A , but this testing is not done routinely. Treatment for LKS usually consists of medications such as anticonvulsants and corticosteroids to help prevent seizures. Speech therapy should also be started promptly in order to ensure the best long-term outlook for children with LKS.",,,

Inverse PCR allows the known sequence to be used to amplify the unknown sequence ligated to it. In contrast to 3C and 5C, the 4C technique does not require the prior knowledge of both interacting chromosomal regions. Results obtained using 4C are highly reproducible with most of the interactions that are detected between regions proximal to one another.

Extra copies of the SMN2 gene modify the severity of SMA.

The majority of adenocarcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occurs in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma predicts disease progression and correlates with survival.  Several grading systems have been proposed, of which the Gleason system is the most commonly used.  Gleason sums of 2 to 4 represent well-differentiated disease, 5 to 7 moderately differentiated disease and 8 to 10 poorly differentiated disease.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy.  Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.",,,

In SCO syndrome, only Sertoli cells (cells that nurture the immature sperm) line the seminiferous tubules (tubes inside the testicles where sperm develop). Therefore, there are not any sperm cells present in the seminiferous tubules. Men typically learn they are affected between ages 20-40 years when being evaluated for infertility and are found to have no sperm production (azoospermia). Other signs and symptoms are rare, but in some cases there could be an underlying cause of SCO syndrome that causes other symptoms, such as Klinefelter syndrome . Most cases of SCO syndrome are idiopathic (of unknown cause), but causes may include deletions of genetic information on regions of the Y-chromosome , especially on the azoospermia factor (AZF) region of Y-chromosome. Other causes include exposure to chemicals or toxins, history of radiation therapy , and history of severe trauma. Diagnosis of SCO syndrome is confirmed with testicular biopsy . Although there is currently no effective treatment, assisted reproductive technology may assist some men with SCO syndrome in being able to have children.",,,

It was discovered by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813. During embryological development, it forms from the nasal (olfactory) placode, at the anterior edge of the neural plate. It is a chemoreceptor organ which is completely separated from the nasal cavity the majority of the time, being enclosed in a separate bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity. It is a tubular crescent shape and split into two pairs, separated by the nasal septum. It is the first processing stage of the accessory olfactory system, after which chemical stimuli go to the accessory olfactory bulb, then to targets in the amygdala and hypothalamus. The vomeronasal organ is mainly used to detect pheromones, chemical messengers that carry information between individuals of the same species, hence is sometimes referred to as the 'sixth sense. ' The VNO has two separate types of neuronal receptors, V1R and V2R, which are seven-transmembrane receptors that are coupled to G proteins. The receptors are distinct from each other and form the large family of receptors in the main olfactory system. Evidence shows that the VNO responds to nonvolatile cues which stimulate the receptor neurons. Information is then transferred to the accessory olfactory bulb as well as other centres of the brain such as the anterior part of the hypothalamus. Its presence in many animals has been widely studied and the importance of the vomeronasal system to the role of reproduction and social behavior (through influence on anterior hypothalamus) has been shown in many studies. Its presence and functionality in humans is widely controversial, though most studies agree the organ regresses during fetal development. [WP,unvetted].",true,UBERON:0002255,UBERON:0002255

The ALV was injected intravenously into Hyline SC chickens and a resulting tumor was twice transplanted in vivo prior to cell culturing (Baba and Humphries, 1984; Baba et al., 1985). The DT40 cells are small, approximately 10 μm in diameter, and have a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio (Fig. 1). They carry IgM on the surface, and although Baba et al. (1985) did not find evidence of secreted IgM, others have (Takagaki et al., 1996; Takami et al., 1999). DT40 cells do release ALV into the surroundings, but in negligible amounts (Baba et al., 1985). In keeping with the observation that nearly 85% of all ALV-induced tumors are disrupted in the c-myc locus, the DT40 cells have integrated the 3′ viral long terminal repeat (LTR) upstream of the c-myc gene ( Hayward et al., 1981). The 3′ LTR is in the same orientation as c-myc, elevating the transcription levels 100-fold in this cell line compared with normal avian bursal cells ( Baba et al., 1985). Whereas Baba et al. (1985) detected a normal and an altered c-myc allele, Kim et al. (1990) reported a possible mitotic recombination event among the parental alleles, as they describe the loss of the normal c-myc allele and instead find two copies of the altered c-myc gene. DT40 cells continue to undergo gene conversion, as seen by testing for the presence or absence of various restriction sites within the light chain variable region ( Thompson et al., 1987). Although the DT40 cell line may best be characterized as being a bursal B cell line, the ongoing gene conversion and the fact that v-myc transformed cells can reconstitute an ablated bursa of Fabricius suggests, that the DT40 cell line is arrested at a bursal stem cell stage of differentiation ( Baba et al., 1985; Thompson et al., 1987; McCormack et al., 1991).",,,

It is characterized by the multiple small reddish-brown pigmented pruritic macules and papules.

Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MCM) is a form of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM; see this term) characterized by the presence of multiple hyperpigmented macules, papules or nodules associated with abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin. [Orphanet_79457]

A form of mastocytosis, a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with abnormal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, especially in the skin and hematopoietic organs. MASTC is an autosomal dominant form characterized by macules, papules, nodules, or diffuse infiltration of the skin, often associated with localized  hyperpigmentation. Gentle rubbing of the lesions induces histamine release from mechanically activated mast cells, causing local wheals, erythema, and often pruritus, a phenomenon termed Darier sign.",,,

Methylation of cytosines located 5' to guanosine is known to have a profound effect on the expression of many eukaryotic genes. In normal cells methylation occurs predominantly in CG-poor regions, while CG-rich areas, called CpG-islands remain unmethylated. The exceptions are the extensive methylation of CpG islands associated with transcriptional inactivation of regulatory regions of imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X-chromosome of females. Aberrant methylation of normally unmethylated CpG islands has been documented as a relatively frequent event in immortalized and transformed cells and has been associated with transcriptional inactivation of defined tumor suppressor genes in human cancers.

To evalute the methylation status of either a specific locus or an entire genome, the isolation and enrichment of methylated DNA can be a useful first step. A high-affinity GST-MBD protein pre-bound to a magnetic bead is used to enable this enrichement  (Fraga M.F., et al. (2003). Nuc. Acids Res, 31, 1765–1774).",,,
